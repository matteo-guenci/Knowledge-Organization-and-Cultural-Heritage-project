            <p>Our project focuses on the Years of Lead, a tumultuous period in Italian history spanning from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. This period, which was marked by intense social unrest, saw the happening of several facts that had a long-lasting effect on Italy's socio-political environment. The items we selected for our project were chosen for their historical significance and their capacity to offer insightful information about the events that took place during the Years of Lead.
              The conceptual map acts as a visual depiction of the information gleaned from the selected items, highlighting in a natural language format how those items are connected to the Years of Lead. The relationships between the many elements are made intuitively clear by using this map, which also makes the data more approachable and simpler to understand to humans.
              The Years of Lead, as main topic, is represented in the middle by the blue node, while the selected items are represented by the red nodes. The subtopics (events, persons, organizations) that connect the items to the main topic of interest are represented by the green nodes. Lastly, the data that was extracted directly from the items is expressed by the orange nodes.</p>

              <p>Our Entity-Relationship model is intended to display information and connections gathered from the conceptual map at a more abstract level. By doing this, the E/R model seeks to present a higher-level view of the domain, providing an overview of the main elements and how they relate to one another without going into specifics. The model focuses on expressing individuals, dates, things, and events as entities, and the arrows that connect them show the relationships between these entities, serving as a visual depiction of the connections between the items and the other different components. These linkages demonstrate the complex interplay between individuals, things, events, and dates, exhibiting patterns and trends that aid in our comprehension of the Years of Lead period.
                The goal of our E/R model is to provide a more generalized view of the domain by presenting metadata derived from the elements of the conceptual map. This higher-level perspective allows for an easier understanding of the project's overall structure, while still maintaining a clear connection to the detailed information provided in the conceptual map.

                    During this step of metadata analysis most of the objects we considered do not have a specific set of metadata standard clearly defined so due to the different features of our items we decided to choose common metadata standards that can guarantee interoperability and interchangeability between different systems and institutions but also a possible integration with the semantic web and LOD environment. The objects indicated by a * have a specific metadata set declared by the provider.

                          <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>PREMIS</strong> (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies) is a metadata standard specifically designed for the preservation of digital objects. Developed and maintained by the Library of Congress, PREMIS helps ensure the long-term accessibility, usability, and understandability of digital resources by providing a set of metadata elements to describe and manage them throughout their lifecycle. PREMIS metadata is typically embedded in a larger metadata framework (such as METS, the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard) and can be implemented in various formats, including XML. PREMIS has wide adoption among digital preservation repositories, as it allows institutions to capture and manage essential information for the long-term management and preservation of digital objects. By implementing the PREMIS standard, organizations can ensure consistent and interoperable metadata practices, facilitating the sharing and exchange of preservation metadata across different systems and institutions.</li>
                          <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>MODS</strong> (Metadata Object Description Schema) is an XML-based metadata standard developed by the Library of Congress to provide a flexible and extensible schema for describing a wide range of resources and facilitating discovery, access, and management of digital objects in libraries, archives, and other information environments. It is also esigned to be both human-readable and machine-readable, making it suitable for various applications, including digital libraries, repositories, and cataloging systems.</li>

                    After defining the metadata standards, we considered some of the properties of the items following the 4W model (Who, Where, What, When) and then we tried to align where possible the different standards in order to find the best way for expressing all the connections of our items through shared vocabularies and semantic ontologies that can guarantee interoperability and accessibility in a semantic web environment. Where it was not possible to find an alignment we indicated it whit a “/”.

            <p>The theoretical model adds a further level of interpretation to our study, improving comprehension of the topic even more. By combining data gathered from the Web and connecting it to the items and their linked entities, this model seeks to enhance the information already available. We used external resources to provide a more complete view of the factors involved, such as the localization of places, the professional roles of people, and the political affiliations of those involved in the events, by connecting our domain to a larger semantic network. In particular, the theoretical model helped us to answer to four important questions:
            <ul>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>WHO?</strong> This aspect focuses on people related to the main topic and their roles. It seeks to identify the individuals involved in the events during the historical period and their respective contributions or positions.<br>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>WHAT?</strong> This component involves the description of the items, their scope, and features. It delves into the nature and characteristics of the items, events, and other elements that are relevant to the Years of Lead.<br>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>WHERE?</strong> This aspect highlights places and meaningful locations connected to the central topic. It explores the geographical dimensions of the events and the significance of these locations within the broader historical context.<br>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>WHEN?</strong> This component focuses on relevant dates and events, helping to situate the items and their related entities within a chronological framework that reveals patterns and relationships over time.<br>
            </ul>
            Exploiting this approach, the theoretical model enables us to retrieve data pertaining to any kind of the elements in our domain. As a result, we were able to develop an enriched Entity-Relationship (E/R) model that includes the newly discovered data. Whit this tool it is possible, for example, to retrieve the information related to a particular person involved in an occasion that took place during the historical era covered by the project as a whole. In the case of Tina Anselmi, the author of the report on "Commissione Parlamentare di inchiesta sulla Loggia Massonica P2", the theoretical model adds more information to her profile, including her professional position, gender, and political affiliation. This expanded knowledge aids in a deeper comprehension of the events, organizations, people and activities associated with the Years of Lead, ultimately presenting a more complete picture of the under discussion historical period.

              Upon defining our theoretical model and generating an enhanced Entity-Relationship (E/R) model using the additional information it provided, we proceeded to develop a new conceptual model that further abstracted and formalized the relationships and data within our project. A more thorough and in-depth understanding of our items, as well as the events, groups, and people associated with them, was the main goal of this new model.
              To achieve this, we used a variety of ontologies, schemas, and vocabularies to represent the many components of our domain in a more detailed and precise manner. By providing a systematic and defined method for expressing the objects and the entities that are associated to them, these tools ensured consistency and interoperability among the model's many parts.
              We followed the subject-predicate-object structure when developing the new conceptual model, which allowed us to properly express the links and interconnections between the items, events, organizations, and individuals involved. This structure fits itself particularly well to the expression of complex linkages and hierarchical data, enabling a more detailed comprehension of the project's numerous elements. Some key aspects of the new conceptual model include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>Items:</strong> We described our items in greater detail, utilizing ontologies, schemas, and vocabularies that captured their specific attributes, characteristics, and connections to the Years of Lead.<br>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>Events:</strong> We represented the events connected to our items using the subject/predicate/object structure, capturing not only their chronological and geographical aspects but also their relationships to other entities within the model.<br>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>Organizations</strong> We integrated information about relevant organizations into the model, detailing their roles, objectives, and connections to the items and events during the Years of Lead.<br>
              <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>People:</strong> We incorporated individuals related to the items, events, and organizations, capturing their professional roles, affiliations, and contributions to the historical period under study.<br>
            </ul>

                <p>In the knowledge representation phase of our project, we focused on creating a thorough and organized representation of the available information. To accomplish this, we created a distinct table for each item, which allowed us to arrange the data in a comprehensible and effective way. Our strategy entailed using a subject-predicate-object structure, which is particularly helpful for producing Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements in the form of triples. This structure made it easier to process and manipulate the data after that. The subject and object components of the triples are expressed in natural language, which makes the information more accessible and easier to understand. 
                  To provide a consistent and controlled vocabulary that improves the accuracy and consistency of the data representation, we choose to employ ontologies previously defined for making the predicates. As a result, the links between subjects and objects are interpreted more successfully and accurately. This is a crucial step of knowledge representation since it makes sure that the data is understandable to both humans and machines.

                For this phase of our project, we focused on selecting four items that we felt were the most representative and important in our area of interest. Our intention was to provide a thorough understanding of the topic by ensuring that these items covered a wide range of elements and views within the domain. We selected the book by Mario Calabresi, the film about the kidnapping of Aldo Moro, the song by Lucio Dalla, and the article on the bombing of Piazza Fontana.
                After that, we proceeded to describe the items and their related entities using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). By employing URIs, we tried to ensure that each item and its associated elements were uniquely identifiable within the digital realm. Our approach aimed to promote integration and interaction across the many parts of our project by facilitating the connection of data and resources.

            In this particular step, we utilized our Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to generate Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements, which are structured in the form of subject-predicate-object triples. For the representation of these RDF statements, we chose the Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) serialization format, which is a compact, human-readable, and easy-to-parse notation.
            Throughout this process, we also incorporated authority control vocabularies such as the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) and the Library of Congress Authority Records. By doing so, we ensured a consistent, unambiguous, and standardized method for representing and retrieving information pertaining to our entities. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of confusion and enhances the interoperability of data across different systems and domains. 
            In addition to the aforementioned authority control resources, we leveraged other sources like DBpedia, Wikidata, and WorldCat to provide more precise and comprehensive descriptions of our entities. By using these various resources and methodologies, we were able to create a robust, interoperable, and semantically rich representation of our data that can be effectively used and understood by both humans and machines.</p>

              Finally, in the last step we created a visual representation of our RDF statements and consequently have a better understand of the new knowledge we managed to produce.
